This repository contains R code for generating the tables in the paper "Clarifying Selection Bias in Cluster Randomized Trials: Estimands and Estimation".

Varying ICC parameter as 0.01 and 0.1 can reproduce the two result tables in the paper.

For questions or comments about the code, please contact Zizhong Tian at <zqt5121@psu.edu>.
