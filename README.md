# code_CRTSelectionBias
This repository contains R code for generating Table 1 in the paper [Li F, Tian Z, Bobb JF, Papadogeorgou G, Li F (2021). Clarifying selection bias in cluster randomized trials. Clinical Trials.]

Varying ICC parameter as 0.01 and 0.1 can reproduce the results under the two settings.

For questions or comments about the code, please contact Zizhong Tian at <zqt5121@psu.edu>.
